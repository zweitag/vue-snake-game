## Getting Started

Run

```sh
yarn install
yarn dev
```

and visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to play the game!

## Building the Game

Run `yarn build` to build the game to the `dist`-folder.

To use it on another website, include the generated `dist/assets` files (`.js` and `.css`), and add a `<div id="app" />` somewhere on your page.
